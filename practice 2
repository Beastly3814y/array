 A parameter array (params array) allows a method to accept a variable number of arguments. It enables passing multiple values of the same type as a single array parameter.
 A reference parameter allows a method to modify the value of an argument by passing its reference rather than a copy.
 Mandatory parameters must be provided when calling a method. They do not have default values and are necessary for the function to execute correctly.
Method overloading allows multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists. 
An optional parameter has a default value and can be omitted when calling a method.

2.	Inheritance: Creating a new class from an existing class.
3.	Polymorphism: Methods behaving differently based on input (overloading & overriding).
4.	Abstraction: Hiding complex implementation details.
5.	Classes & Objects: Core concepts of OOP.
